# Structs in C 🧠

This folder contains various C programs demonstrating how to use `struct` in different scenarios. Each file focuses on a specific concept such as pointers, copying, arrays, and dynamic memory.

## 📂 Programs

- 'FuncPtrsElements_2.c'
- 'FuncPtrsElements.c'
- 'Structs_Copy_with_Pointers_Elements.c' Demonstrates shallow copy behavior with structs containing pointers.
- 'StructsPointers.c' Demonstrates how pointers interact with structs, including value modification and pointer reassignment.
- 'Wrapping_C-Arrays'   Demonstrates Wrapping C-array with a struct so we can use assignment operator to copy from one structure to another without need to a loop on each element.


## 📌 Key Concepts Covered

- Struct declaration and initialization
- Pointer to struct and dereferencing
- Copying structs vs referencing them
- Reassignment of struct pointers


## 🧪 How to Run
Compile with GCC:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
